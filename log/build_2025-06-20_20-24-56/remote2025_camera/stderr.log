[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddetect_messages.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "detect_messages", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "detect_messages"
  with any of the following names:

    detect_messagesConfig.cmake
    detect_messages-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "detect_messages" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "detect_messages_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "detect_messages" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
